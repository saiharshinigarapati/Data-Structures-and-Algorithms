# Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms repository! This repository is a personal project where I explore and implement various data structures and algorithms using multiple programming languages: C++, Python, Java, and R.

## About the Repository

The goal of this repository is to build a comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms for educational purposes, coding practice, and reference. By implementing each concept in different languages, I aim to deepen my understanding of these concepts and the nuances of each programming language.

### Languages Used:

- **C++:** Known for its efficiency and control, C++ is a great language for understanding the performance aspects of algorithms and data structures.
- **Python:** With its simplicity and readability, Python is excellent for quickly implementing and testing algorithms.
- **Java:** Java's object-oriented nature makes it a perfect fit for designing data structures and algorithms with real-world applications in mind.
- **R:** While not traditionally used for this purpose, implementing algorithms in R can offer unique insights, especially in data analysis and statistics.

## Repository Structure

Each data structure and algorithm is organized into separate directories, categorized by programming language. Within each directory, you'll find:

- **Source Code:** Well-commented source code for each implementation.
- **Documentation:** Detailed explanations of the logic, usage, and complexity.
- **Test Cases:** Sample inputs and outputs to test the implementations.

## Topics Covered

This repository covers a wide range of topics, including, but not limited to:

- **Basic Data Structures:** Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs
- **Sorting Algorithms:** Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort
- **Search Algorithms:** Binary Search, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search
- **Advanced Structures:** Heaps, AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees
- **Algorithmic Techniques:** Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, Divide and Conquer

## How to Use

To use or test a specific data structure or algorithm:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the desired directory based on the language and topic.
3. Read the documentation for instructions and details.
4. Run the source code in an appropriate environment or IDE.
